  title: "Crossing the river by feeling the stones"
  description: "<p>Deng Xiaoping once described managing the economy as crossing the river by feeling the stones—in other words have a direction but be adaptive. But in a world of constant change, how do you determine the right thing to do? Which pebble to tread on? How do you understand where you’re going and where you need to go? How do you know if your strategy is right? Is there even such a thing? </p><p>Simon Wardley examines the issue of situational awareness and explains how it applies to technology. Using examples from government and the commercial world, he explores how you can map a complex environment, identify opportunities to exploit, what techniques to use and learn to play the game.</p>"

  title: "Keynote: Successful digital transformation - seven strategies to drive change"
  description: "<p>Digital technology has only begun to penetrate industries. Companies will need to launch even
more digital initiatives to expand or build digital capabilities aimed at business efficiency or top-line
revenue growth. Recent research from McKinsey shows companies that get digital transformation
right win market share, and those that don’t actually have a negative ROI for their investments.</p>
<p>There are many challenging aspect of digital transformation. Emerging technologies will continue
to overhaul business models, relevant talent will be scarce and managers will keep on struggling to
operate with a disruptive mindset. In this talk, seven strategies to manage a journey through
innovation and an outcomes-first approach will be presented - as well as tools for accelerating it all
in an era of unprecedented and widespread transformation.</p>"

  title: "Progressive Organizations"
  description: "<p>Every year we hear about another novel approach to management: Holacracy, Teal, Sociocracy, and whatnot. Many proponents of these methods offer a view that their approach will become the mainstream, or even standard, way of managing organizations in foreseeable future. Should we embark on a journey of transforming our companies to one of these models? If so, which one is the way to go?</p>
  <p>In this presentation, we’ll look beyond technicalities of each method and define common themes and underlying patterns. These themes and patterns are what in the first place enabled emergence of new approaches to management. They are also what fuels the changes we experience in novel workplace. In that course of  discussion we will dive into the concepts of autonomy, transparency and alignment. We will cover different contexts of leadership. We will explore how the end game of organizational design may look like.</p>
  <p>Only through understanding this bigger picture we are able to discern valuable parts from the snake oil. That, in turn, enables us to transform our organizations not by applying a method as a recipe but rather using it as inspiration to find the right approach in any given context. Ultimately, that’s what gives an organization an edge both in commercial context and, even more importantly, on a job market.</p>"

  title: "Warum agile Teams nichts mit Business-Agilität zu tun hat"
  description: "In diesem Talk berichte ich von einer Agile Transition in die ca. 600 Leute involviert waren. Das erklärte Ziel war es, Time-to-Market von Initiativen zu verkürzen, damit man schneller auf Kundenbedürfnisse reagieren kann und somit die Business Agilität steigt. Um das zu erreichen,  wurde eine Reorganisation durchgeführt. Alle Teams wurden crossfunktional aufgestellt, damit das notwendige Wissen für die Entwicklung im Team vollständig vorhanden ist. Zusätzlich wurden die Teams nach Produkten aufgestellt, um Abhängigkeiten zu entfernen. Visualisierung der Arbeit, Standup-Meetings und Retrospektiven machten die Agile Transition komplett - einzig die erwartete Verbesserung blieb aus. In dieser Session zeige ich, was wir getan haben, um die Situation doch noch zu verbessern und das Ziel “mehr Business Agilität” zu erreichen. Ich zeige auch, wie man eine Agile Transition in dieser Größenordnung angeht, damit man erst gar nicht in die missliche Lage kommt, keine Verbesserungen zu sehen. So viel sei vorab erwähnt: nicht auf Teamebene starten - das spart nicht nur Nerven sondern auch noch sehr viel Geld!"

  title: "Welcome to the Jungle"
  description: "Startup entrepreneurs didn’t invent agile or lean thinking. Both the principles and practices used by ''cutting-edge'' startups and innovative web shops came out of large corporations. And yet, I keep running into resistance when I’m training in multinationals. I'm told, ''That may work in your little startups, but our environment is too complex.'' So, after decades of working with small teams in greenfield startup projects, I took a project management job at the biggest, oldest, global company I could find, just to prove that the theory works even under complex conditions. I’ll be sharing my stories and experiences after almost a year of taking the lean principles I've used in startups into a world of distributed teams, annual performance reviews, conference calls, and acronyms. Some are funny; some are sad, but overall my findings will offer encouragement to people who punch a time clock and wear shoes to work."

  title: "Okaloa Flowlab simulation"
  description: "<p>Okaloa Flowlab is a new, experiential, way of teaching and coaching 21 st century business agility that
  involves the entire organization. Rather than teaching a specific agile or lean method, it allows
  participants to explore the foundations of flow, self-organization and active learning that together
  form the corner stones of agile business.</p>
  <p> On a tactical level, Okaloa Flowlab consists of a set of
  engaging business simulations that range from teaching business agility basics to advanced
  simulations that scale up to enterprise level (including upstream and cross-team). As the simulations
  are not targeted at a specific business domain or a specific function, experience shows that
  attending an Okaloa Flowlab workshop has a viral, mobilizing effect on all levels (including
  management) and across all functions (not just IT, but also HR, Marketing and communications,
  Finance, Legal, Product management, …).</p>
  <p> On a more strategic level it allows participants to
  experience the difference between 20 th century old style linear, reductionist thinking about Agile
  (''either-or'', ''recipe'' thinking) and 21 st century integrative, systems thinking (''and'', ''context-
  sensitive'' thinking). Scrum, Kanban, SAFe, LeSS, Lean start-up, Sociocracy, Holacracy, … practitioners
  can all benefit from this new type of thinking as a way to more effective coaching. By setting aside
  any dogmatic discussions, it builds a common, deeper, understanding between practitioners of
  different lean and agile methods leading to change that is more resilient to setback.</p>
  <p>Join this Okaloa
  Flowlab simulation to get a taste of a more integrative approach to teach and coach 21 st century
  business agility.</p>"

Visualizing is the first step to learn about your work and the system wherein it is processed - how it arrives, how it flows through your system and delivered to the requester.</p>
  <p>But all the learning isn’t worth anything, if you never start to manage the flow of work. Only by managing the flow of work and only then, you can cross the chasm and move from sustainable service delivery to service-oriented service delivery.</p>

  title: "A Siberian tale of two Kanban implementations"
  description: "Arello Mobile and Pushwoosh are two sister companies based in Novosibirsk in Siberia, Russia. 3 years ago, the workplace was stressful and the days very long. Managers and clients were constantly fighting, while teams failed to meet delivery dates. We chose to pursue Kanban to address these challenges. Adoption at Arello was relatively easy and the maturity of the implementation is now quite deep. Pushwoosh has been another story. There was skepticism and resistance. This talk describes in detail what has been achieved at Arello, a mobile application development company of around 50 people, and contrasts it with the challenges at Pushwoosh, a push notification service with a similar number of staff. Both companies have the same owners and share some common staff and resources, however, cultural reaction to Kanban was very different. Some of the latest Kanban coaching concepts including use of the Kanban Maturity Model are now being applied at Pushwoosh. There are indications this measured and thoughtful approach is likely to succeed."

  title: "Whole Organisation Kanban: how to start; how to scale"
  description: "<p>When considering how to use the Kanban method throughout the whole of your organisation, there are two key questions:</p><p>* how to start?</p><p>and</p><p>
  * how to scale?</p><p>Kanban already contains answers to these questions. _Start_ from where you are, without initially changing current processes, roles or responsibilities; see your work as a flow of value to your customers; and agree together to evolve the processes, responsibilities, policies and organisation, in order to make services more fit for the customers' purposes. _Scale_ by seeing your organisation as a network of interdependent services; scaling out sequentially one service at a time; designing each from first principles; and using management feedback loops on specific cadences, to balance demand with capability, and enable the organisation to service its customers' needs ever more effectively.</p><p>Such simple explanations hide the hard work, determination and leadership (at all levels) that is needed to achieve true and rapid transformation, as well as on-going continuous improvement. Thus the presentation will look both at the ''How-tos'', and at the experience of organisations on this journey, to learn what 'whole organisation Kanban' means and how it can be achieved.</p>"

Coaches look for most appropriate approaches to introducing change in organizations.</p><p>Where can we find answers to so diverse questions?</p><p>This talk will be focussed on two key points: what the Kanban Maturity Model brings to managers, teams and coaches, and how to use it for evolving organizations’ capability to meet their business purpose.</p>"

  title: "Kanban in SAFe waters"
  description: "As part of a wider SAFe initiative at the Berenberg private bank in Hamburg, the IT Operations department (consisting of appr. 80 people in 8 teams, providing the IT services backbone for about 800 people) initiated an agile / Kanban transition. In this talk, we will tell the unpolished story about how the Kanban implementation that started at the end of 2016 went, from both the external Kanban coaches' and the Berenberg Program Manager’s perspectives. The initiative is still ongoing. To date, a colorful mix of technical and non-technical teams within IT Operations have been partly or fully ''kanbanized''. Not all teams are alike! We will share the spectrum we had there, and the different characteristics and challenges present. We will use this example to illustrate how a Kanban transition is different from a ''classic'' agile transition eg. a Scrum adoption. As this implementation was part of a wider SAFe transition within the bank, we will also talk about touch points that we had (and that we had not), and how we aligned with the SAFe structure. As a successor to an Excel sheet, a portfolio-level board feeding into the teams’ systems has been established recently, and we’ll have more experiences to share there. So far, it has worked brilliantly as a catalyst for communication amongst the management team. In this talk, we will share our experiences in the form of a dialogue, covering the good, the bad, and the ugly. As a side note, you will also hear why we think ''Kanban is for IT-Ops only'' is really bullshit :)"

  description: "<p>Most teams exploring Kanban never go beyond Proto-Kanban. Although this provides significant improvements, we ask ourselves, ''How can a full Kanban System evolve?''</p><p>When working at Ding.com, JP and Jose (and Andy de Vale) had that same question. The company had a wide education programme to introduce all its staff to Kanban. The next step was to encourage teams to drive their own improvements and support teams in their discovery of new ways of working.</p><p>Initially, teams struggled to decide what parts of Kanban would help them to improve. They were like a writer facing a blank page: blocked and anxious.</p><p>The coaching team created the Kanban Guide. With the Guide, teams were able to pull coaching support based on their ongoing needs, rather than the coaches pushing what to do next. This completely flipped the coaching relationship.</p><p>In this session, JP and Jose will introduce their case study and show how they used the Kanban Guide at Ding. We believe that this approach leads to healthier and deeper improvements to work environments, Kanban or otherwise. We want to validate this in other organisations.</p>"

  description: "Computest is a fast growing company, currently with about 120 people, based in the Den Haag area, specialising on testing services and consultancy throughout the Netherlands. At the beginning of 2016 Computest started out on an ambitious mission. ‚Towards a self-managing organisation‘ as CEO Hartger Ruijs, 2017 entrepreneur of the year in the Den Haag area, pointed out in his first blog on the topic. (http://corporate-rebels.com/guest-blog-hartger-ruijs/)
</br></br>This mission was driven by:
  <ul>
	 <li>Computest´s growth rate and the question of how to handle an organization with 50+ people without an additional management layer</li>
	 <li>the need to become more market and customer driven</li>
	 <li>the conviction that self-organisation is a key driver for becoming a truly agile enterprise</li>
	 <li>the willingness to find a way of how to preserve Computest´s both informal and entrepreneurial spirit while growing</li>
  </ul>
<p>The presentation shows how Computest followed its mission. What have been the key drivers so far? What kind of obstacles did the company meet and how did it deal with them? What are the biggest challenges for the future? By reviewing what we experimented with so far, I´ll address:</p>
	<ul>
    <li>how the journey got started: from functional silos to multi-disciplinary teams, from a traditional to an agile approach, from hierarchical management to leadership services,</li>
	  <li>how we applied lean and systems thinking to overcome a few classic pitfalls (e.g. the temptation of standardised recipes)</li>
	  <li>why focusing on customer centric value streams and work flow was essential</li>
	  <li>how decision-making authorities were distributed and a smart system of feedback loops installed</li>
	  <li>how a culture of coaching and sparring became mission-critical on all levels</li>
	  <li>what we are currently busy with</li>

  title: "Want less conflict? Do Nothing."
  description: "<p>Leadership has been famously defined as the capacity to translate vision into reality. In business, this can be achieved in a variety of ways. Some leaders believe in actively involving others in decision-making processes; other set out to use unilateral control, contingent rewards or sheer economic force. Finally, there are those that believe that in order for the vision to be realized, you don’t have to do anything.</p>
<p>Traditionally these three types of leadership have been labeled as democratic, autocratic and laissez-faire. At the outset of the WWII, in 1939, the effectiveness of these three types of leadership was put to the test by one of the most famous research programs in social psychology, orchestrated by Kurt Lewin and his colleagues. Since then, a certain consensus has been developing in organizational psychology. Although for simple tasks some levels of autocracy might work, for complex and knowledge-heavy tasks, democratic leadership has been deemed as better than both than autocratic and laissez faire, producing better group outcomes and less tensions. Laissez-faire, in particular, has been found to produce high levels of uncertainty, leading to greater aggression and conflict. Hence, non-leadership has been considered ineffective, unnoteworthy, and ultimately bound to be forgotten.</p>
<p>In practice, however, laissez-faire leadership has been quietly finding its way back to the business world. With recent developments in Holacracy, self-management, sociocracy and teal organizations, the idea of getting rid of clear leadership roles and responsibilities has been gaining popularity and acclaim. Is this new support for laissez-faire leadership bound to reproduce the already recognized challenges related to conflict, aggression and uncertainty avoidance?</p>
<p>In my research, I focus on how different leadership styles and decision making cultures are connected to how conflicts are resolved. Contrary to my initial beliefs, I found that laissez-faire leadership can be effective in building effective conflict resolution cultures. However, certain conditions need to be satisfied. Based on my studies, I argue that the performance and effective conflict resolution under non-leadership depends on three things: the reasons why laissez-faire leadership is employed, the beliefs held about the employees by the team introducing self-management and the level of managerial competencies among employees. In my presentation, I will show how these issues are addressed by different organizations, how they influence the effectiveness of conflict resolution and finally, what lessons stem for all organizations considering the employment of laissez-faire leadership.</p>"

  title: "Alignment: the forgotten child"
  description: "In the Lean/Agile community we talk a lot about autonomy, empowerment and self-organization. While all this can be extremely valuable, any organization also needs sufficient alignment, in order to be successful. Individuals, teams and business units all must be pulling at the same thread. Projects, initiatives and resources must be organized in a way that supports the company‘s strategic goals. In this talk I will discuss the concept of organizational aligment share some ideas what can be done to increase alignment."

  <p>One of my best examples of Lean Exercise in private life is the trip around the world in 325 days which I did with very small budget, minimal equipment and one rule – no hotels J. My work journey shows a couple of different stations, from being an engineer to leading IT Projects and teams into the world of Agility, where I had different roles over time. Currently I am working at trivago, heading the Organizational Agility area – my passion here is detecting and resolving company bottlenecks.</p>"
